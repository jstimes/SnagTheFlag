Refactoring/Cleanup
    - action type to available action types, control abstractions
    - serialize game state, keep track
    - use gameState only?
        - use animations on top of gameState?
    - Make every render size in terms of Grid.TILE_SIZE
        so it's easy to resize.

MVP features
    - flag capturing
    - game over logic.
    - wait for particle to hit before moving on, character movement
        - Freeze controls?
    - level selector - unlock one at a time.

AI improvements:
    - Chase flag carrier
    - Use heals/grenades.
    - Aim random +X%

Things to experiment with:
- destructible obstacles
- Fog of war
- pickups
- To respawn, or not to respawn.
- Teleport pads
- classic explosive barrels
- engineers that can turn on turrets
    - or secure new spawners.

Level creation:
- Symmetry option (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
- Set name
- Grid dimensions

Things to copy to template:
- Theme
- closePath on grid lines
- particle system
- update math & ui libs
