Refactoring/Cleanup
    - action type to available action types, control abstractions
    - serialize game state, keep track
    - use gameState only?
        - use animations on top of gameState?
    - Make every render size in terms of Grid.TILE_SIZE
        so it's easy to resize.

MVP features
    - why don't controls work when AI is playing.
    - better char class & action selection UI

AI improvements:

    - Defensive mode, eliminate mode

Things to experiment with:

    - pickups
    - Teleport pads

Level creation:
    - Symmetry option (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
    - Set name
    - Grid dimensions

Things to copy to template:
    - Theme
    - Grid search/path algs
    - particle system
